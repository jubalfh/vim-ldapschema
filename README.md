==============

VIM LDAP schema syntax files + autocommands; you know the drill.

# Note: Looking for the author

I'm not the author. I have no idea where I found these files, I can't
remember the source and google does not find any of the keywords
I searched for. The vim script archive does not have it either.

If you're the author, let me know at *miroslaw+p+misc* at
*makabra.org*.
